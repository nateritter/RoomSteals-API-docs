## Basic Authentication

Hotels For Hope uses Basic Authentication to allow access to the API. You can request Hotels For Hope API credentials by partnering with us and emailing [support](mailto:hello@hotelsforhope.com).

All examples using CURL in this documentation specify the Basic Authentication header with the following: `-H 'Authorization: Basic {BASE64-ENCODED-STRING}'`

Please note that there are different domain names used in different endpoints described in this document. `api.travsrv.com​` may use different credentials than ​`groups.alliancereservations.com​`. In some cases they may be the same, however. Your case is specific to your organization. Please contact support if you need assistnace with these credentials.
