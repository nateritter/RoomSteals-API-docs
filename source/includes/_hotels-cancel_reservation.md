## Hotel Reservation Cancellation

To cancel a reservation you will need the `reservationId` and `itineraryId` returned in the reservation creation response.

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.travsrv.com/hotel.aspx?\
username={API-USERNAME}\
&password={API-PASSWORD}\
&siteid={SITEID}\
&reservationId=915892\
&itineraryId=733525\
&ipAddress=127.0.0.1\
&userAgent=shell\
&userLanguage=en\
&_type=json"
```

> The above command returns JSON structured like this (edited for brevity):
