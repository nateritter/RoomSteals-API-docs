## Update an Existing Member

Using the Site Admin's token you may update an existing member by POSTing a *URI encoded* JSON string to this endpoint. Successfully calling this endpoint also generates a new member token for the user in the `CurrentToken` property, which you should save for them if you want to use the "Get a Member by Token" call.

You may notice this call is exactly the same as the "Create a New Member" call.

> The JSON data to stringify and encode may look something like this (not yet encoded):

```json
{
    "Points": 100,
    "Names": [{
        "ReferralId": "mytestuser1@gmail.com",
        "FirstName": "Testme",
        "LastName": "Tester",
        "Email": "mytestuser1@gmail.com",
        "Address1": "123 Main Street",
        "HomePhone": "5551231212"
    }]
}
```

<aside class="notice">
The `Points` attribute is only necessary if you want to update the number of points for the member specified. Please note that it will update the member's points to the value specified, not increment or decrement.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
The JSON structure includes an array of `Names`, which seems to infer the ability to create more than one person. However, in reality, you should only send this call for one member at a time.
</aside>

<aside class="notice">
`"DeleteMember":true` will delete a member, or deactivate a member if the user has made reservations. The JSON response will simply show a `MemberId:0` instead of what the `MemberId` once was, but if you try to get that member by it's token, it will respond appropriately that the member no longer exists and/or is deactivated.
